# Josh Bowley

Physics student at the University of Exeter on the Professional Placement pathway. My work focuses on numerical simulation, embedded systems, scientific programming, and practical laboratory analysis. I prefer building systems that are physically accurate, mechanically reliable and implemented cleanly.

This profile links to the projects and modules I actively maintain.

## Public Repositories

### [sauce-pot-dispenser](https://github.com/joshbowley/sauce-pot-dispenser)
A multi-axis electromechanical system developed with an engineering collaborator and built for a real business.
#### Key features:
- Arduino Mega control
- Ten stepper motors using AccelStepper
- State-machine architecture
- Custom mechanical design and 3D-printed components
Developed with support from a University of Bath engineering scholarship, this project combines embedded control, system architecture, and practical engineering.

### [scientific-programming-in-c](https://github.com/joshbowley/scientific-programming-in-c)
Coursework and technical work for my Scientific Programming in C module (PHY2027).
#### Includes:
- RK4 numerical integrators
- N-body gravitational simulation (Solar System modelling)
- File-based plotting outputs
- Modular, well-commented C code
- Mathematical algorithms and numerical methods
This repo demonstrates performance-minded C programming applied to real physical systems.

### [practical_physics_II](https://github.com/joshbowley/practical_physics_II)
Jupyter notebooks and analysis scripts from my second-year physics laboratory modules.
#### Includes:
- Uncertainty propagation
- Weighted linear regression and curve fitting
- Spectroscopy, diffraction and X-ray analysis
- Clean markdown explanations and reproducible workflows
This repo reflects my approach to rigorous, well-documented scientific data analysis.
